    "judgment": "The Supreme Court laid down twin conditions for granting bail in NDPS cases: (1) the accused should not be guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, and (2) the Court should be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of such offence.
